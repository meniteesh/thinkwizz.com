            <h4 style="padding: 40px; font-family: cursive;">Think Wizz! Believes that study need of each student is different and traditional courses for Medical and Engineering entrance do not focus on individual study needs and most of the students could not perform up to their potential in final exams.
            <br>
            We guide & train each student differently which is based on students individual study need.

            To accomplish we keep smaller batches (10-15 student) so that our trainers can focus on each student and give them ample of time to ask and discuss concepts and questions.
            <br>
            Think Wizz! Offers topic wise class, special concept building class along with exam oriented curriculum.
            Our personalized teaching, short notes, regular problem class and regular test helps our students to prepare confidently for forthcoming exams.</h4>
